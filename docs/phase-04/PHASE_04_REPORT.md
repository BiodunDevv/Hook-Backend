# Phase 4 Report

## Implemented

- Backend-owned guest/customer/Partner baskets grouped by source State.
- Customer addresses and coverage validation.
- Persisted versioned checkout previews and idempotent per-State confirmation.
- Immutable Order/item/address/customer/policy/price/quote snapshots.
- Paystack Hosted Checkout, raw signed webhook evidence, polling, deduplication, mismatch records, and provider-neutral boundary.
- POD review, confirmation call, Super Admin override, prepayment conversion, cancellation, settings, and customer eligibility restoration.
- Self-scoped Partner-assisted customer, basket, checkout, payment-instruction, and Order APIs.
- Idempotent customer notifications and fulfilment-ready outbox events.
- Shopper product, negotiation, addresses, State cart, checkout, payment, Order list, and Order detail routes.
- Admin POD, Payments/Reconciliation, Commerce Settings, and immutable Order detail surfaces.
- One-command full database reset and complete Phase 1-4 seed pipeline, including QA policy/settings/customer fixtures.

## Validation Record

Automated tests, fixtures-as-tests, snapshots, coverage, and test frameworks were not created or run, per instruction.

- Backend `npm run build`: passed.
- Backend `npm run docs:swagger`: passed; generated 190 paths.
- Backend non-fixing ESLint: passed with 0 errors and 360 existing warnings, primarily legacy `no-explicit-any` findings.
- Backend `npm run seed`: passed from a full drop of database `hook` through the complete Phase 1-4 dataset.
- Seed verification output confirmed 37 States, 3 Markets, 3 Runner assignments, 1 active Hook Partner account/location, 6 catalog submissions, 12 published products, 255 variants, active policy versions, Commerce Settings, delivery coverage, a verified customer, and a default address.
- Admin `npx tsc --noEmit`: passed after removing stale generated Next.js route metadata.
- Admin `npm run lint`: passed.
- Admin `npm run build`: passed; 56 routes generated and the retired arbitrary Order-creation route is absent.
- Shopper `npx tsc --noEmit`: passed.
- Shopper `npm run lint`: passed.
- Shopper `npx expo-doctor`: passed all 18 checks.
- `git diff --check`: passed in all three repositories.
- Paystack sandbox checkout: passed locally with a real Hosted Checkout authorization, successful test payment, provider status re-query, signed `charge.success` processing, invalid-signature rejection, replay deduplication, customer status polling, and exactly one `ORDER_APPROVED_FOR_FULFILMENT` outbox event.

## Outstanding Release Gates

- The configured Paystack dashboard must deliver a signed webhook to the deployed Render endpoint after commits `0d0799c` and `88608ce` (or successors) are deployed; the equivalent signed sandbox flow has passed locally.
- Production deployment with retained historical data still requires the documented migration path; fresh development and QA environments use `npm run seed` exclusively.
- Phase 5 must implement fulfilment consumers, physical sourcing, handover collection, returns, and refunds.

NOT READY FOR PHASE 5
