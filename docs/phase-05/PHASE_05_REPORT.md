## Scope

Phase 5 adds the post-order operational foundation on the existing `development`
branch. The backend owns fulfilment state, Runner assignment, Hub custody,
consolidation, shipment state, Partner custody, returns, refunds, scope checks,
idempotency, and audit events. The Admin and Runner portals consume those
endpoints, and the Shopper order detail now reads customer-safe fulfilment
progress and can submit an eligible issue.

## Delivered

- Fulfilment task, Runner package, Hub package, consolidation, shipment,
  exception, Partner custody, return request, refund, and logistics webhook
  models with public IDs and idempotency fields.
- Durable `ORDER_APPROVED_FOR_FULFILMENT` outbox consumption with atomic leases,
  retry backoff, and dead-letter handling.
- Operational deadline processing for SLA breaches and ageing Partner custody,
  with idempotent exceptions and audit context.
- Runner task actions: accept, sourcing, securing, packing, Hub label creation,
  issue reporting, and scoped same-State reassignment with optimistic locking.
- Hub package receiving with six-digit scan credentials and visible QC pass/fail.
- Complete-item enforcement before consolidation and sealing.
- Manual shipment booking and guarded status transitions. GIG and Fez remain
  disabled readiness boundaries until verified provider contracts and credentials
  are configured; a clearly tagged development-only logistics simulator is
  available for local lifecycle QA.
- Signed, deduplicated logistics webhook handling with normalized tracking
  transitions and integration-event state capture.
- Partner custody receipt/release with hashed, limited-attempt collection codes
  and a seven-day custody window.
- Pay-at-Handover payment confirmation releases the shipment only after verified
  payment evidence; it does not create duplicate fulfilment events.
- Customer fulfilment progress and 24-hour return request entry points.
- Refund request and Paystack provider-processing paths with captured-balance
  limits, idempotency-key matching, provider reference persistence, and failure
  state capture.
- Admin control tower, Hub, shipment, returns, and refund workspaces; Runner
  fulfilment queue and task detail workspace; Partner custody workspace with
  scoped receipt visibility. Hub operations now separate inbound Runner
  packages from received packages and expose consolidation/sealing; shipment
  operations expose manual booking and valid status progression; returns have
  a reasoned review action. Task detail, same-State Runner/Hub reassignment,
  exception resolution, and refund-request creation are exposed as audited
  operational actions.
- Shopper order detail now offers backend-controlled Paystack resume/polling,
  customer-safe shipment and Partner-custody progress, and return/refund
  status without exposing provider or internal cost data.
- Phase 5 seed script appended to the full-reset `npm run seed` chain. Legacy
  Vendor, Booth, Driver/Fleet, settlement, and OPay fixtures are retained only
  as inactive or compatibility records after the Phase 5 fixture pass.

## Validation

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` in `Hook-Backend` | Passed |
| `npx eslint "{src,test}/**/*.ts" --no-fix` | Passed with existing warnings; 0 errors, 477 warnings |
| `npm run docs:swagger` | Passed; 228 paths generated, including Phase 5 Runner, Hub, task detail/reassignment, exception resolution, logistics readiness, Partner custody, return, and refund paths |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` in `hook-admin` | Passed |
| `npm run lint` in `hook-admin` | Passed |
| `npm run build` in `hook-admin` | Compiled successfully; final worker output was confirmed exited |
| `npx tsc --noEmit` in `Hook-App` | Passed |
| `npx expo-doctor` in `Hook-App` | Passed, 18/18 checks |
| `npm run seed` | The normal SRV-based run was interrupted by transient Atlas DNS; the final full reset and Phase 1–5 rebuild passed using resolved replica hosts supplied only in the command environment |
| `npm run start` + local HTTP smoke | Passed with the resolved replica-host connection: `/health` 200, `/api/v1/public/home` 200, `/swagger-spec.json` 200, request IDs and security headers present |
| Manual authenticated Phase 5 smoke | Passed locally: seeded admin login 200; control tower, task detail, Runner/Hub assignment lists, exceptions, Hub workspace, consolidations, shipments, returns, and refunds all returned successful responses; unauthenticated control-tower access returned 401 |
| Paystack test-mode provider check | Passed: Paystack transaction listing returned HTTP 200 with `domain: test`; a ₦100 test-mode initialization returned a matching reference and hosted checkout URL; provider status verification returned `abandoned` without a charge |
| Hosted Paystack callback/webhook check | Passed: callback returned HTTP 302 to `hook://payments/return`; unsigned webhook returned 401; a correctly signed synthetic non-payment event returned 200 with `received: true, ignored: true` |
| GIG/Fez readiness check | Correctly unavailable: no enablement flags, webhook secrets, credentials, or verified provider contracts are configured; audited manual booking and the explicitly gated development simulator are the active test paths |
| Development logistics simulation check | Passed: readiness exposed the simulator only with `NODE_ENV=development LOGISTICS_SIMULATION_ENABLED=true`; the same flag was disabled under `NODE_ENV=production`; the reset seed is configured to leave one complete sealed consolidation unbooked for this development-only path. The destructive re-seed was not rerun after this fixture-only change because the local `.env` targets the production Atlas database |

No automated test suite was created or run, per the Phase 5 instruction.

## Remaining operational prerequisites

Paystack test-mode credentials, initialization, status polling, callback
redirect, and webhook signature handling are verified. A real successful
customer payment and Paystack `charge.success` delivery were not simulated, so
end-to-end settlement evidence remains a manual sandbox exercise. Local QA can
use the explicitly gated logistics simulator, but it does not replace GIG or
Fez provider verification. GIG and Fez remain intentionally disabled until
verified contracts and credentials are supplied. No automated test suite was
created or run, per the phase constraint.

## Git state

No push, merge, history rewrite, or protected-branch update was performed.
The existing user-owned `Hook-Backend/.env.example` deletion and
`hook-admin/lib/api.ts` modification were preserved.
